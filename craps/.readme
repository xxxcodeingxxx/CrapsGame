# Simple Craps Game

This is a very simple static HTML site with some JavaScript for the game logic. Idea of the game is to roll the dice, as long as you don't hit 7 or 11 you get to roll again. As you roll you will accumulate points based on the dice. For example if you roll a 5 and a 3 you will get 8 points. At any point you can choose to hold and keep accumulated points an pass to next player. If you do hit a 7 or 11 you will loose any accumulated points for that turn. First person to 100 wins!!

## Installation

Just download the craps folder and run the index.html file to start playing.
